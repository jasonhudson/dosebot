                        <h3>Profile</h3>
                        <p>Independent Isabelle is 21 years old and is a student in 3rd level education, studying for a degree in Business Management. She lives in Grahamstown, South Africa, with her two friends from college. She works part-time as a waitress, in a cafe near her college. She has three younger siblings and visits them and her parents every weekend.</p>
                        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                        <p>Isabelle has done contemporary dance from a young age and is a member of Grahamstown dance society, where she trains three times a week with her dance troop.</p>
                        <p>She also has a love for baking, having grown up with a mother who always had an apple pie in the oven.</p>
                        <p>Isabelle also loves to relax with a book after a long day at college, and enjoys hanging out with friends and family at the weekend.</p>
                        <p>She hasn’t  travelled outside of South Africa yet but dreams of travelling the world one day and would love to spend a year working overseas, in the UK or Ireland.</p>

                    <div class="tab-pane" id="2b">
                        <h3>Online Behaviour</h3>
                        <p>Isabelle is a digital native and so tech is part of her everyday life. However as an adopter of new technologies, she’s more of an early majority than an early adopter and prefers not to ‘learn’ how to use a new piece of tech but goes for applications that her friends are using and that she feels are intuitive - easy and straightforward to use. She uses apps for communication, views content for entertainment and uses calendars and notes for reminders and college work.</p>
                        <p>She also does a lot of online research for her studies and college projects. She likes apps that help her organise herself and manage her study time and her daily tasks.</p>

                    <div class="tab-pane" id="3b">
                        <h3>Value Proposition</h3>
                        <p>Isabelle is a very independent and optimistic young woman. She’s strong-willed and determined to succeed in life. She is very respectful of her parents and how hard they have worked to give her the opportunities she has.</p>
                        <p>Independent Isabelle would like to be more in control of her TB treatment and feels DoseBot would assist with her medical adherence and give her the flexibility needed to keep up with her studies, while educating herself on how to keep fit and healthy, both mentally and physically, while she undergoes treatment.</p>
                        <h3>Design Challenges</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To make something very serious and clinical feel welcoming and easy to use.</li>
                            <li>No clutter - we do not want to add to an already busy life by over-complicating the product offering or giving too much choice.</li>
                            <li>Minimum steps needed for each feature - needs to be a quick process.</li>
                            <li>Wants to see progress at a glance.</li>

                            <p>To have flexibility around the TB DOTs programme, so she can take her pills where and when she wants to, allowing her to continue her studies with as little disturbance as possible and complete her degree as planned.</p>
                            <h3>Situation</h3>

                            <h3>Expected Outcome</h3>
                            <p>"So that I can be part of a DOTs TB programme and work my treatment plan around my own schedule."</p>

                            <p>To have a list of all the drugs she needs to take each day, so she can plan out her day ahead of time and know what needs to be taken when.</p>

                        <h3>A day in the life...</h3>
                        <p>Every morning at 6am, Isabelle opens DoseBot on her smartphone and reads through the list of pills she needs to take that morning. She takes the dose for each pill, out of her pill bag and gets a glass of water. She starts to film her pill-taking with her phone and confirms when she has taken each dose. Once she’s completed and confirmed she's taken all her doses, she saves and uploads her video, so her healthcare professional can check her adherence against her treatment plan.</p>
                        <p>She is now finished her medication for the morning and she can head off to college, knowing that her progress has been reported to her doctor and she is one step closer to recovery.</p>
