          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p class="lead">Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious illness that involves a lengthy and toxic drug treatment plan, which requires strict daily adherence by the patient. Failure to adhere to their daily drug treatment plan can lead to Drug-Resistant TB, which is highly contagious. A TB patient would typically consume 14,000 pills over the course of 6 – 30 months of treatment for Drug- Resistant <abbr title="Tuberculosis">TB</abbr>, with only a 50% chance of <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#tbstats" id="tbstats-ref">cure</a>.</p> 
          <p><a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#DOTs" id="dots-ref">DOTs</a>(Directly Observed Treatment, short-course) is the TB control strategy recommended by the World Health Organization. It involves the patient being observed taking their medication on a daily basis, either at a clinic or by a nurse visiting their home. This strategy looks at control not treatment and support. Research told us that these patients need to be empowered to take ownership of their own recovery. We want to give the patients the tools they need to adhere to their treatment plan but with a more holistic approach by offering them support, motivation and education in order to deal with all aspects of recovery. Adherence alone will not empower them.</p>

          <h1>Product Definition</h1>
          <p class="lead">DoseBot is a medicine adherence mobile application that empowers and encourages TB sufferers to stick to their treatment.</p>
          <p class="lead">It offers patients an alternative way to be part of a DOTs programme.</p>
          <p>From the outset, we set about using technology to try and improve the patients' journey through this treatment program. We decided that one of our USP’s and core functionality would be the use of video recording that allows the patient to be part of a <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#VDOTs" id="vdots-ref">video direct observation therapy (VDOT)</a> program and thus comply with the monitoring of their treatment. Research showed us that a video-based approach using mobile devices provides meaningful direct observation for TB patients, which is associated with high adherence and fewer healthcare resources.  We felt that we were also empowering patients to take control of their treatment and still comply with their DOTs programme, by providing them with their own portable clinic in their back pocket. As opposed to having to visit numerous healthcare centres, on a daily basis. As a team, we felt that VDOT fully fits the vision in aiding and assisting treatment of TB elimination and our App with this functionality could contribute to this eradication.</p>
          <p>DoseBot in addition allows patients to create their own medication schedule (based on their prescribed treatment plan), deciding what time of day they want to take their pills and record their daily pill taking session. They can then securely submit this to their healthcare professional for review. This adherence feature can also be used to record drug intake for those not specifically on a DOTs programme but who still need to be monitored by health-care professionals or family members. They simply disable the camera functionality and just log the medication intake by checking off each pill as it’s taken.</p>
          <p>DoseBot also offers the patient help in dealing with the psychological and clinical effects of the disease, through supplying tailored and verified information and advice on nutrition, exercise and mental health.</p>
          <p>DoseBot will act as their assistant on this treatment journey, reminding them what pills to take and when to take them.  DoseBot will also send them updates on their progress and offer words of support and motivation. DoseBot will give the patient the tools, and confidence to complete this drug treatment journey themselves.</p>
